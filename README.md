This is a backend for storing and loading text (or json) in a generic way. It is simply a PHP script that stores and delivers data in a folder structure, based on various keys and parameters sent in by an external script, and validates the source against a hard-coded list of known hosts to prevent general usage.

In the *resources* folder are a couple of Articulate Storyline files that can be used to publish packages that can be then incorporated into Articulate Rise packages. These offer a way to generically store plain text as a response, and a way to export the reponses to PDF.

This repo is sister to https://github.com/frumbert/blobstorebackend - a Moodle plugin that performs the same thing.
